For my project, i chose with my mentor a game to code and she guided me through the lesson and this code.
I was proud of how i completely mapped the projectout individually and how I  barely used starter code to complete my project especially with importing the complex turtle and fucntions
as i ran my project a few errors appeared and after a day of trying to figure whats wrong, my mentor helped me and guided me with through these problems and I figured out why the board was incorecctly being printed
In the future, I will continue to brainstorm ideas and execute them hopefully to the point where i need absuletly no help constructing the code. 
A challenge I faced was brainstormign where to start with coding this. after my mentor guided me a little bit i was able to complete it independelty.
