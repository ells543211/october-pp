Ellee: In this project, I declared variables for the floors, state, rows and players. I also used for loops to loop through creating the range for printing the grid as a turtle. Additionally, I created functions in which I worked with user interaction in adding each tile as well as when they win four in a row. Overall I really enjoyed coding this project and expiramenting with errors such as they pattern and the user interaction not working properly.
